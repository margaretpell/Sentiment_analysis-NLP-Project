# Sentiment_analysis-NLP-Project
This project use sentiment analysis which is a branch of NLP to analyze “What can public opinion tell us about the russia’s war against Ukraine in 2022?” through  social 
media posts/tweets posted recently on the war of Ukraine against russia.Firstly, I use TF-IDF for feature engineering. Then I train logistic regression, SVM, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Random Forest  model and tune hyperparameters for sentient analysis. For sentiment analysis, I use pretrained model from python library and my best models. Based on sentiment analysis, I use LDA model to identify the factors that drive sentiment. Also, I use pie chart, histogram and bar plot to visualize the results.
